Di Library v1.0.3

General purpose library for speeding up the development process. Inspired by both the C++ standard library and the Qt framework.
Compile using the C++ 20 standard, or refactor the code at your own cost.

Before starting any project using the library,please take a look at the "coding_conventions.md" file

Enjoy !
